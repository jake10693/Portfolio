                   web development suits my interests and personality in many ways: </p>

                        passionate about it (In fact, I think I just found my next project).
                        But moving on from my career, I really enjoy having deep conversations 1-on-1 with people. I find small talk
                        to be redundant an and pointless. I'm always up for an adventure and a new experience. If there is anything
                        I've learned in my 26 years of existence, it's that life is short and not worth wasting on meaningless
                        encounters/experiences.
                        Life is only worth living if it's to the fullest, and I intend to continue doing that.</p>
