    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <img src="IMG-2206.png"width="200" height="150">

    <p>I am 26 years old and currently employed as a personal trainer as well as an independent contractor. I've been dipping my toes into different majors and entry level job positions across a handful of different industries. 
        It has taken me until now to really find career path that I can dive into head first without hesitation. I've always been fascinated by learning foreign languages
        and my favorite subjects growing up were English, Math, and Science.So it baffles me that I never learned about or heard of what coding really was or what it can do until now. Ever since 
        discovering it, I've been hooked. Ive changed my major for the 9th and final time to computer science, I signed up for an intensive coding bootcamp, I'm looking for work as a transcriptionist to improve typing speed, and have started on my first web development side-project.
    </p>
    <p>I'm excited to have a career in software development for many reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To have the opportunity to work from my computer.</li>
        <li>I can work in a field that requires or at least allows a creative aspect.</li>
        <li>I'm intrigued by how limitless the possibilties are for what kind of software can be created.</li>
        <li>The ability to work remotely will allow me to do the one thing that I've always wanted, to travel the world.</li>
        <li>It has an endless opportunity for freelance jobs.</li>
        <li>I have an unexplainable obesession with typing on a keyboard (weird, I know).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Quite frankly, I could easily write a daily blog going on-and-on about all the in-depth reasons why I am so passionate about it (In fact, I think I just found my next project).
        But moving on from my career, I really enjoy having deep conversations 1-on-1 with people. I find small talk to be redundant and pointless. I'm always up for an adventure and a new experience. If there is anything I've learned in my 26 years of existence, it's that life is short and not worth wasting on meaningless encounters/experiences.
    Life is only worth living if it's to the fullest, and I intend to continue doing that.</p>
