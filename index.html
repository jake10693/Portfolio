  <div class="p1"> <p>I am a 26 years old and am currently working as well as self-emplowed as a personal trainer. I am looking for a career change to both stabalize my time spent working and the my income. 
       web development suits my interests and personality in many ways: </p></div>
       <div class="p1">  <ul>
        <li>I'v always wanted to have the opportunity to work from my computer.</li>
        <li>I can work in a field that requires or at least allows a creative aspect.</li>
        <li>I'm intrigued by how limitless the possibilties are for what kind of software can be created.</li>
        <li>The ability to work remotely will allow me to do the one thing that I've always wanted, to travel the world.
        </li>
        <li>It has an endless opportunity for freelance jobs.</li>
        </ul> </div>

        <div class="p1"> <p>Quite frankly, I could easily write a daily blog going on-and-on about all the in-depth reasons why I am so
            passionate about it (In fact, I think I just found my next project).
            But moving on from my career, I really enjoy having deep conversations 1-on-1 with people. I find small talk
            to be redundant an and pointless. I'm always up for an adventure and a new experience. If there is anything
            I've learned in my 26 years of existence, it's that life is short and not worth wasting on meaningless
            encounters/experiences.
            Life is only worth living if it's to the fullest, and I intend to continue doing that.</p></div>
